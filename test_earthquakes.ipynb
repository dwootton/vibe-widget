            "- Duplicate event records: Event '6000PJR6' appears twice with different magnitude values (4.2 vs 4.18), suggesting multiple reporting stations or revised estimates\n",
            "- High missingness pattern: 50% of records (615/1230) are missing location, latitude, longitude, and datetime, suggesting two data sources or incomplete event reports\n",
            "- Geographic hotspots: Afar, Ethiopia (63 events) and Xizang, China (49 events) show concentrated seismic activity, indicating active rift zones and tectonic boundaries\n",
            "- Depth data sparsity: 81% missing depth values suggests difficulty in hypocenter depth determination or different reporting standards\n",
            "- Magnitude range: Events span from minor (1.96) to major (7.05) earthquakes, with mean of 4.43 indicating focus on detectable/reportable events\n",
            "- Dominant magnitude type: Body wave magnitude (mb) used in 783 cases, indicating teleseismic detection methods predominate\n",
            "- Week-long temporal window: Data covers January 1-7, 2025, suggesting either a recent snapshot or ongoing data collection\n",
            "- Global coverage: Longitude range (-179.96 to 179.91) and diverse locations indicate worldwide seismic monitoring network\n",
            "\n",
            "## Suggested Visualizations\n",
