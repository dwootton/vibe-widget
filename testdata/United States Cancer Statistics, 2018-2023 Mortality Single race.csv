Caveats:
"1. 'Not Applicable' is displayed for all data values when sex-specific cancers are combined with the wrong sex. More"
"information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cancermort-v2023.html#Genital Cancers List."
"2. The ""Show Totals"" checkbox is disabled when data are grouped by Cancer Sites or by Childhood Cancer, because aggregate"
"values are displayed in the table. Also be aware that charts and maps containing both aggregate and detail data could be"
"misleading."
"3. About rate comparisons: <ul><li> For consistency with the data on cancer incidence, the cancer sites in mortality data were"
"grouped according to the revised SEER recodes dated March 1, 2018 (see SEER Cause of Death Recodes:"
"http://seer.cancer.gov/codrecode/.). Because NCHS uses different groupings for some sites, the death rates in this report may"
"differ slightly from those published by NCHS. In addition, under the ICD, there can be differences in mortality and incidence"
"coding. For example, there are several codes for mesothelioma in ICD-10 (depending on the primary site). However in ICD-O-3, one"
"code captures all of the primary sites that mesothelioma affects. Note that this dataset is based on underlying cause of death."
"Kaposi Sarcoma deaths included in this dataset are only those deaths with underlying cause of death attributed to Kaposi"
"Sarcoma, and do not include deaths where the condition was a contributing cause of death, or subsequent to another underlying"
"condition. </li><li> The population used to age-adjust the rates in this report is the 2000 U.S. standard population, which is"
"in accordance with a 1998 recommendation of the US. Department of Health and Human Services. The 2000 U.S. standard population"
"is based on the proportion of the 2000 population in specific age groups (younger than 1 year, 1-4 years, 5-9 years, 10-14"
"years, 15-19 years, . . . 85 years or older); the proportions of the 2000 population in these age groups serve as weights for"
"calculating age-adjusted incidence and death rates. NCHS, however, uses a different set of age groups in its age adjustment of"
"death rates, and thus the cancer death rates in this report may differ slightly from those published by NCHS. </li><li> Deaths"
"of persons of unknown age are not included in this data set. Death rates may differ slightly from other reports where deaths of"
"persons of unknown age are included. </li></ul>"
"4. Because the vast majority of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) cases have developed in association with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)"
"infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), HIV/AIDS is listed as the underlying cause of death. Therefore, KS"
"death counts have been moved to the Miscellaneous category."
