            "- Eliminating stops shows the highest fuel savings potential (9.5% to 29.2%), suggesting that stop-and-go traffic has the most significant impact on fuel consumption\n",
            "- There is an inverse relationship between KI (kinetic intensity) and distance: cycle 2012_2 has high KI (3.30) with short distance (1.3 mi) while cycle 2145_1 has low KI (0.68) with long distance (11.2 mi), indicating urban vs. highway driving patterns\n",
            "- Short, high-intensity cycles (2012_2) show greater fuel savings potential across all categories, particularly for stop elimination (29.2%) and idle reduction (17.4%), typical of congested urban driving\n",
            "- Long, low-intensity cycles (2145_1) show minimal acceleration improvement potential (0.1%), suggesting already smooth highway-type driving\n",
            "- The first row serves as a header row with column labels, indicating the table was extracted from a PDF with formatting challenges\n",
            "- Speed improvement savings are relatively consistent (2.4% to 5.9%) across different cycle types compared to other intervention categories\n",
            "\n",
            "## Suggested Visualizations\n",
            "- Stacked bar chart comparing fuel savings percentages across all four intervention types (Improved Speed, Decreased Accel, Eliminate Stops, Decreased Idle) for each Cycle Name\n",
            "- Scatter plot of 'KI (1/km)' vs 'Distance (mi)' with bubble size representing total potential fuel savings (sum of all intervention percentages)\n",
            "- Heatmap with Cycle Names as rows and the four fuel savings categories as columns, with cell color intensity representing percentage values\n",
            "- Grouped bar chart showing each fuel savings category side-by-side for different cycle names to facilitate direct comparison\n",
            "- Pie chart for each cycle showing the relative contribution of each intervention type to total fuel savings potential\n",
            "- Line chart showing how fuel savings potential for each intervention type varies with kinetic intensity (KI)\n",
            "- Horizontal stacked percentage bar chart showing the composition of fuel savings opportunities for each driving cycle\n",
            "\n",
            "## Data Quality Issues\n",
            "- ⚠️ First row contains header information rather than data, creating a mixed header/data structure that needs cleaning\n",
            "- ⚠️ Column names contain line breaks ('\\n') indicating PDF extraction artifacts that should be normalized\n",
            "- ⚠️ Generic column names ('Column_4', 'Column_5', 'Column_6') should be renamed to their actual meanings from the header row\n",
            "- ⚠️ Only 6 rows with 3 data rows (excluding header) represents a very small sample size, limiting statistical analysis\n",
            "- ⚠️ No metadata about vehicle types, test conditions, or geographic locations that would provide context\n",
            "- ⚠️ Missing information about baseline fuel consumption to calculate absolute fuel savings\n",
            "- ⚠️ No indication of measurement uncertainty or confidence intervals for the percentage values\n",
            "- ⚠️ Cycle naming convention (e.g., '2012_2', '2145_1') is not self-explanatory and lacks documentation\n",
            "- ⚠️ No data validation rules evident (e.g., whether percentages can exceed certain thresholds or be negative)\n",
